      "Imagine a real brain neuron. It doesn't constantly shout information. It stays quiet until it gets enough input, then it 'spikes'â€”sends a single, sharp signal. A Spiking Neural Network (SNN) copies this. Instead of processing continuous numbers like regular AI, it processes these discrete 'spikes' over time. This makes them potentially much more power-efficient, which is why they are great for neuromorphic computing.",
