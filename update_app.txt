🚀 How to Release Updates:
Make your code changes as usual
Bump version in TWO places:
package.json → change "version": "0.1.0" to "0.1.1"
src-tauri/tauri.conf.json → change "version": "0.1.0" to "0.1.1"
Commit and tag:

git add .
git commit -m "xyz"
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.1

Wait for GitHub Actions to build both platforms (~10-15 mins)
Done! Users will get update prompts on their next app launch
📝 Important Notes:
First Release: You'll need to manually run npm install after this implementation to install the new packages
GitHub URL: I set it to torbiz-project/torbiz-desktop - update the URL in tauri.conf.json and updateService.js if your repo path is different
Windows: Users get seamless automatic updates
macOS: Users get semi-automatic (download + manual install) due to no code signing
