🚀 How to Release Updates:
Make your code changes as usual
Bump version in TWO places:
package.json → change "version": "0.1.0" to "0.1.1"
src-tauri/tauri.conf.json → change "version": "0.1.0" to "0.1.1"
Commit and tag:

git add .
git commit -m "xyz"
git tag v0.1.1
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.1

Wait for GitHub Actions to build both platforms (~10-15 mins)
Done! Users will get update prompts on their next app launch
📝 Important Notes:
First Release: You'll need to manually run npm install after this implementation to install the new packages
GitHub URL: I set it to torbiz-project/torbiz-desktop - update the URL in tauri.conf.json and updateService.js if your repo path is different
Windows: Users get seamless automatic updates
macOS: Users get semi-automatic (download + manual install) due to no code signing

i have completed the github push and the commit is there and i can see it on github commits, but the github actions didn't start any action, like it used to before you edited  when it was only for the .dmg file...the GitHub actions didn't start or it isn't doing anything even after the commit....that's the problem....check your code to see if everything's fine....also check some errors on my terminal and tell me if i should concern myself with those or are they resolved already?
